# Homework4

Not too sure how to work with github just yet so I hope I uploaded the code properly, I wasnt sure how to upload it thorugh the terminal but I will look up a tutorial. But Im having the following problems with my code:

In my budget_application.cpp:

(line 30) Im tring to call show_menu() but it gives me an error.
I tried using scope resolution( Menu::show_menu() ) but it would not call the function. show_budget doesnt give me an error so Im not sure whats wrong.

(line 38) It tells me that the 'redefinition of...as diferent kind of symbol', this makes me think I declared it as something other than the void type. What i tried to do to fix it was to include the header file where the function was declared first atop the .cpp file (ive made mitakes like that before and it worked) but this one just didnt seem to work. Not to sure what else could be wrong with it.
